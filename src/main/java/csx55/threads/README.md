# How to run the main program!
The main file for this program is MatrixThreads.java

Again, this was previously built using Gradle. I am figuring out how to download the Gradle dependency and get updated commands.

Way to run the java file after gradle build:
'java -cp build/classes/java/main/ csx55.threads.MatrixThreads 8 3000 31459'
