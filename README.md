# Multrithreaded Matrix Multiplication

The objective of this project was to get comfortable with using threads and synchronization mechanisms. 

This project was the most fun I have had in a coding project in a while because it was teaching me concepts that I felt could apply to something I wanna do in the future.

What I learned about:
- Synchronization mechanisms and when to use them.
- Differences between the utilization of a thread pool and just creating multiple random object threads.
- The role data structures and locking mechanisms play when designing concurrent programs.
- How to debug and prevent concurrency issues.

### Notes:
This project was built using Gradle. I left tools for loading the module or downloading the tool for your OS here in my network overlay project: [https://github.com/joe-maitan/csx55-hw1/tree/main](https://github.com/joe-maitan/Network-Overlay)
